Create the functionality for an open-source web app for saving, refining, and reusing prompts with a minimal UI (frontend already designed, but you may adjust to match existing style): users type messy prompts, refine via LLM, toggle original/refined, save to local history (original + refined), display 3 prompts at a time with auto-scroll to latest, long-press to toggle view, click to copy, store API key in localStorage, and persist data locally without backend.
