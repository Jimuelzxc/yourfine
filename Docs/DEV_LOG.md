**DEV_LOG.md Management Instructions**



This document outlines the rules for interacting with my development log. Please follow these steps precisely:



1.  **Add all mentioned items:** Whenever I mention a bug, feature request, or general note, automatically add it to this `DEV_LOG.md` file. Do not perform any other actions.

2.  **Clarify when necessary:** If my notes/input are unclear, rewrite them into clear and concise wording before adding them.

3.  **Use the correct section:** Categorize all new entries into one of the following sections:

    * **Bugs:** for issues that need to be fixed.

    * **Feature Requests:** for new functionality to be implemented.

    * **General Notes:** for development thoughts, observations, and miscellaneous notes.

4.  **Do not fix anything:** Under no circumstances should you attempt to fix, implement, or take any action on the items listed. Your only task is to log the information for future reference.

5.  **Status indicators:** Use '❌' for pending items and '✅' for completed ones.
