## üöÄ Core Evolution Ideas

### 1. Intelligent Prompt Assistant
**Current**: Manual prompt refinement with static AI models
**Proposed Enhancement**: Context-aware AI assistant that learns from user patterns

**Implementation Details**:
- **Smart Refinement Suggestions**: AI analyzes prompt history to suggest improvements before manual refinement
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation context across multiple refinements
- **Learning Mode**: AI learns from user acceptance/rejection of suggestions to improve future recommendations
- **Prompt Quality Scoring**: Real-time feedback on prompt effectiveness with improvement suggestions

**Technical Approach**:
```javascript
// Enhanced API structure
const intelligentRefinement = {
  analyzePrompt: (prompt, userHistory) => {
    // Analyze against user's historical successful prompts
    // Return quality score and improvement suggestions
  },
  contextualRefine: (prompt, conversationContext) => {
    // Maintain conversation flow and context
  },
  learningFeedback: (originalPrompt, refinedPrompt, userAcceptance) => {
    // Store learning data locally for future improvements
  }
}
```
